## Supported Versions

AutoRedact is an aggressive release project. **We only support the latest release.**

| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0.0 | :x:                |

If you are running an older version, please upgrade immediately. We do not backport security fixes to older versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in AutoRedact, please follow these steps to report it responsibly:

### ⛔ DO NOT OPEN A PUBLIC ISSUE

Publicly reporting a vulnerability can put the community at risk before a fix is available.

### ✅ Private Reporting (Recommended)

We use **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting**. This allows you to open a private advisory directly in this repository.

1.  Go to the **Security** tab.
2.  Click **"Report a vulnerability"** (green button).
3.  Fill in the details.
